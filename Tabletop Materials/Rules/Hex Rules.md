#### **Hexploring Procedure:**

1. Make any daily status rolls (illness saving throws, special abilities, etc). Any effects occur before traveling to the next hex. 
2. Roll on Biome Table (d20)
3. Roll on Modifier Table (d20)
4. Roll on Weather Table (d8)
5. Roll on Encounter Table (d20)
6. Roll for and play out any encounters indicated by previous table
7. If no dungeon, take Full Rest, make a danger roll, and/or repeat the above the next day.
8. If there is a dungeon and you want to enter, you may take a short or full rest before entering.
#### Rules:

**Danger Roll:** Players must occasionally make checks to determine if they run into dangerous situations or not. Usually this happens at _night_ during _full rests_. To make a danger check, roll 1d20. On a 2-19, nothing happens. On a 20, the characters happen upon a random _magical item_, on a 1 they are attacked by enemies (roll on the enemy table).

**Movement Speed:** The party moves one hex per day when exploring, and one room every ten minutes while in a [[Dungeon Rules|dungeon]]. 

**Night:** When characters travel at night, they roll with disadvantage on any checks involving sight or searching. When characters choose to forego _rest_ and travel through the night, they are [[Status Conditions|tired]]. Wears off after full rest. Every night, players must make one _danger check_ to determine if they have a night-time encounter or not.

**Full Rest:** At least 8 hours of true relaxation (including sleep, entertainment, other forms of recovery) are required each night for a full rest, or the characters become tired. After a Full Rest, characters recover all of their health and lose all [[Status Conditions|status conditions]] (unless otherwise stated). Taking a full rest consumes 1 camp supply/rations.

**Small Rest:** If characters relax for 1 hour, they recover 1 _[[General Rules|Hit Dice]]_ and lose all status conditions (unless otherwise stated). You may only take one small rest per day.
#### Special Hexes:

**The Capital:** The starting point for (nearly) all adventures. Located at a randomly determined hex. The largest city in the area and an important location for many reasons.
	**Special Rules:**
		- **_Party Management:_** In the capital, party members can be switched out for other party members or new recruits. Party members left in _the reserve_ at the Capital are healed to full health after 1 day, but will leave the party if not engaged for more than a month (30 days). It costs 300g to hire a new party member, and they are always randomly rolled and level 1. 
		- **_Economic Hub:_** Nearly anything can be bought or sold in The Capital. Anything available on the _general merchant list_ is available, as is anything from _craftspeople_. There are no _exceptional merchants_ or _masters craftspeople_ in the capital, though they may appear in time. You can sell anything from your inventory for its stated price.
		- **_Training:_** All sorts of training are available here. At any time, you may pay 200g to level up any of your party members by one level while in The Capital. There are other places and methods for leveling up, but this (for now) is by far the easiest and most consistent.
		- **Starting Point:** If a full party is killed during an adventure, a new party is rolled and they start in the capital.
