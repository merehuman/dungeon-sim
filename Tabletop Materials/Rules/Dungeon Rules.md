#### Rules:

**Dark:** Unless otherwise stated, all rooms in all dungeons are dark, requiring a _torch_ for normal vision. Without a torch, all checks to search or find things are made with disadvantage, as are any damage rolls.

**Gold Per Room:** Each room you explore has 10 gold in it that you find without effort. You cannot pick up the gold, however, unless all enemies in the room are killed.

**Locked Doors/Chests:**

**Traps:**

**Trapped Doors/Loot:**

**Turns:** Exploring a new room or making any other significant _action_ in the dungeon requires one turn, which translates to ten minutes. Every 6 turns (1 hour) you must roll on appropriate dungeon encounter table. A torch can burn for 1 hour.
