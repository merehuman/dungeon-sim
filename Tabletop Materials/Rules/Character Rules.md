#### **Character Creation Procedure:**
1. Roll stats (3d6 x 3) (Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom)
2. Roll race
3. Roll class
4. Roll HP
5. Roll personality trait
6. Roll attacks or spells based on class
7. Randomly choose +2 extra torches or +2 extra rations (all characters also start with 1 of each)
8. Roll on the corresponding tables for 1 item/tool, 1 piece of clothing, 1 weapon, and 1 armor. If you rolled a Cleric or Wizard as your class, only roll 1d8 to determine weapon (and cannot wield found weapons above 1d6 damage); if you rolled a rogue you can only use one-handed melee weapons. All items and weapons should be listed together under "Items/Equipment".
9. Calculate total armor value given the above outcomes.
10. Roll 3d6 to determine starting amount of Gold
11. Update stats based on outcomes above.
12. Roll to name the character, rolling 3d20 for first part, second part, and modifier. Apply the modifier to the name.

#### Rules:

**Death:**

**Leveling:** In the presence of particular npcs or at particular sites (including in the capital), the player may pay 100g to level up a single character. Other special encounters and loot items may also provide free level ups. Upon leveling, the character rolls their hit dice and adds that much health, gain 1 in the stat that they have a class bonus from. Wizards and clerics gain a new spell every 2 levels (3, 5, etc) in addition to one cast/day at the same interval. Fighters do not gain new martial attacks when they level.

**Starting Equipment:** All characters start with one randomly rolled standard quality weapon, one randomly rolled loot item, one day of rations, one torch, and 1d10 gold. Torches and rations are tracked collectively after character creation.

**Personality Trait Bonuses**: Though you will have many bonuses available to you from various personality traits, only two may be active at a time. You can change which are active among your available combinations at the start of every day.
