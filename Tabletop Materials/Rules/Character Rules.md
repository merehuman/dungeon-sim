#### Rules:

**Death:**

**Leveling:** In the presence of particular npcs or at particular sites (including in the capital), the player may pay 100g to level up a single character. Other special encounters and loot items may also provide free level ups. Upon leveling, the character rolls their hit dice and adds that much health, gain 1 in the stat that they have a class bonus from. Wizards and clerics gain a new spell every 2 levels (3, 5, etc) in addition to one cast/day at the same interval. Fighters do not gain new martial attacks when they level.

**Starting Equipment:** All characters start with one randomly rolled standard quality weapon, one randomly rolled loot item, one day of rations, one torch, and 1d10 gold. Torches and rations are tracked collectively after character creation.

**Personality Trait Bonuses**: Though you will have many bonuses available to you from various personality traits, only two may be active at a time. You can change which are active among your available combinations at the start of every day.
