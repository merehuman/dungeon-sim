#### Rules

**_Encumbrance_:** Each character have slots to carry **_StrengthX2_** items. Carrying more than that will cause the character to move _[[Status Conditions|slowly]]_, and grow _[[Status Conditions|tired]]_ if they move that way for a day.

**_Loot Quality:_** Every time you roll a loot item, you also roll its quality, which can range from flimsy to unique to magical. Only roll for other loot modifiers if specified.

**_Light:_** Takes 1/2 encumbrance slot to carry.

**_Heavy_**: Takes 2 encumbrance slots to carry.
