| 5              | Hot                   | Traveling a full day will leave the party tired the next day.                                                                                         |
| 6              | Raining               | The party cannot encounter _npcs_. Any fire damage is halved.                                                                                         |
| 7              | Severe Storm          | Party is too overwhelmed to stop for _npcs_ or _landmarks_ - skip encounter if either is rolled. All attacks made outside are made with disadvantage. |

_Note: Any_ weather event can occur in _any_ biome. If the result doesn’t seem to make sense (a hot day in the tundra?) find a way to explain it through fiction.

#### **NPCs:**

| 1              | Thief                  | A thief approaches the party and steals their second most expensive item. If any character in the party is _[[Character Tables\|perceptive]]_, the party catches the thief. |
| 3              | Explorer               | Will sell a treasure map for 50g. The map leads to the nearest _dungeon_, guaranteeing the party will find a dungeon entrance in the next newly explored hex.               |
| 4              | Traveling Merchant     | A merchant that will buy anything for regular price, and will sell mundane loot. Will also sell a _rumor_ about the region for 10g.                                         |

| 5              | Someone who could Help | Roll a new party member                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6              | Someone in Need        | Roll on *[[Quest Tables\|hexcrawl quest table]]*                                                                                                                            |
#### **Events:**

| **Roll (1d10)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |

| 2 | An Illness | A party member falls ill, and cannot participate in combat or make any other checks until they’ve had a _full rest._ |

#### **Biome Specific Landmarks:**

###### Hills:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark**      | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1              | Flesh Hill        | The party encounters a hill made of flesh. Lowest _wis_ party member must roll a wis save at disadvantage: on both success and failure, a _doppelgänger_ of the target party member forms from the flesh and either attacks or joins the party, depending on the result of the _wis save._ The doppelgänger has all of the statistics of the copied party member, but none of their equipment or abilities. |
| 2              | Spherical Hill    | The party finds an inexplicably spherical hill. The party can leave the hill alone, attempt to dig into it, or try to climb it. Nothing happens unless they dig to the core of the hill (takes 1 hour, roll 1 random encounter during this time) where they find a _magical_ item: a misc. treasure worth 500g (use book of symbols, Oursler book, or other generative resource to determine the item).     |
| 3              | Valley of Night   | The party enters a strange valley, inside of which it is eternally night. Resting here, the party will sleep for two days, increasing any time pressure they are under. If they chose to push through, they will end up _tired_ in the next hex, but no time will have passed.                                                                                                                              |
| 4              | Mysterious Tubing | The party encounters a weird pile of tubelike items. The party can chose to take one, which will unfold into a _land octopus_ in 1d6 days, instantly becoming hostile to any creatures it is around at that time.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

###### Plains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Forbidden River | A river that emerges out of and runs into an impenetrable fog. The party may chose to ride down the river and will end up 1d6 hexes away in a random direction, or can ignore it to no effect. The river can be used any time the party enters the hex. |
| 2 | Abandoned Castle | An old ruined castle, all in pieces except for a locked throneroom. If you can get passed the locked door, you encounter an _bountiful secret lair_, guarded by an _undead powerful enemy_. |
| 3 | The Glittering Mire | An area of the plains steeped in moisture—it is _flooded_ here, and moving across it takes 2 days (roll another encounter). At the end of each day, however, generate and acquire one _treasure_. |
| 4 | Pearlhenge | A circle of huge black pearls. Acts as a _teleportation circle_, but every time it is used the encounter must fight 1d4 _eldritch creatures_. |

###### Mountains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Otherworldly Rock | The party finds a _fragile eldritch_ _rock_, if they chose to pick it up must fight 1d4 _eldritch creatures_. |
| 2 | Teetering Boulders | The characters move through a terrifying canyon with teetering boulders surrounding them on all sides. Roll 1d20: on 10 or below there is a rockslide and all characters must roll dex to avoid the rocks or take 1d4 damage each. If anyone rolls a nat. 20 they permanently gain +1 dex because they are so confident in themselves after the episode. |
| 3 | Impossible Boulder | The party encounters a boulder of impossible/inconcievable shape/size. The party may interact with the boulder in order to enter a pocket dimension, which is actually an _ultra-dark wizard tower_. |
| 4 | The Labyrinthine Ridge | A canyon so steep and skinny that characters can lose sight of each other. Roll 2d20: if either are a 5 or below, one of your characters becomes _lost_. They find their way back to _the capital_, and can be re-recruited there. |

###### Forest:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Crumbling Well | An entrance to an _Amazing Flora, Flooded, Ruin_ dungeon. To get out of the dungeon, each party member must make a _dex check_, taking 1d4 damage on a fail (falling once before climbing up). |
| 2 | Bloody Shrine | A shrine in the forest, guarded by 1d4 _demonic giant falcons_. If the party defeats the falcons, they can chose to take 1d4 damage per party member in exchange for gaining one level each (damage occurs after level up). |
| 3 | Whispering Grove | A grove of trees which whisper a prophecy to the party, who may place a dungeon entrance at a random hex up 1d4 hexes away. |
| 4 | Infinitely Tall Tree | The party finds an infinitely tall tree. If they succeed in climbing it using _dex checks_, they find a bird that will carry them to any hex up to 3 spaces away. |

###### Desert:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Sand Pit | A huge dip in the sand - party makes _str checks_ or falls in, all becoming _lost_ (must roll another encounter) and each failing character takes 1d4 damage. |
| 2 | Restless Dunes | An evershifting area of sand. Party is _tired_ when they arrive at the next hex, but find a _magical weapon_ has built itself out of sand during the night. |
| 3 | Solar Convent | A small gathering of nuns out in the desert, living under the constant rays of the sun. In addition to functioning as standard merchants, the nuns will level up a party member at the standard rate and will endow the full party with lifelong resistance to fire damage for 500g. |
| 4 | Boiling Oasis | A cursed oasis: everything about it seems fantastic, but the fresh water in the center of the copse of gorgeous trees and grazing fauna is super hot boiling water, which cannot be cooled. The water will scald anyone who tries to drink it, causing 1d4 damage, but can be bottled. |

###### Tundra:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Echoing Chapel | A chapel in the center of an open frozen tundra, filled with howling winds. At the center of the chapel is the frozen body of an _undead elemental_ _saint_. The party can try and get him to join the party (make a character sheet), or if they defeat him they can loot his body for two _elemental_ loot items. |
| 2 | Crystalline Theater | An outdoor theater made entirely of a lightly glowing hard crystal. The party can sit in the stands and will hallucinate a future event, placing a dungeon entrance in a random hex up 1d4 distance from the theater. After the hallucination fades, the characters may either fight the suddenly hostile _stone zombies_ and find one piece of random loot or run away to the next hex. |
| 3 | Shivering Trail | The party seems to be lost before realizing that they can follow a path ahead of them which can’t be seen but is instead felt as a massive negative change in temperature. The party can stay on the path taking 1d4 cold damage and moving on to the next hex _or_ can roll again on the encounter table and not take the damage. |
| 4 | Restless Glacier | An enormous, football field sized glacier, which moves extremely fast (for a glacier). It seems to follow the party, slowing their progress: roll for a second encounter; the characters are *[[Status Conditions\|frozen]]* for the first round of that encounter, if it is combat. Because of the hugeness of the glacier and its seemingly magical following of the party, the next hex is also a tundra. |

###### Canyon:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Shaking Gorge | A region constantly undergoing a low level earthquake. Lowest dex party member must make a check, if they fail they *break their leg*, taking 1d4 damage and becoming *[[Status Conditions\|slowed]]*. |
| 2 | Chromatic Cliffs | Region made up of multicolored stone; party finds a _wandering mystic_ being attacked by a _random elemental_. |
| 3 | Scaled Cavern | The party finds a _one room dungeon_ with walls made of scales. Roll one _[[Loot Tables\|fragile draconic]]_ loot item and all party rolls a dex check for stealth. If more than 2 of the party members failed, you are attacked by a *[[Master Enemy List|small red dragon]]*. |
| 4 | Pillars of Life | A region made up of series of interconnected pillars. The highest wis party member rolls a wisdom check or becomes enticed by the pillars, running off into the canyon. The party can leave the party member (perhaps encountering them again if they ever return to this hex); or can follow them, becoming _lost_ but find one _[[Loot Tables\|magic weapon]]_; If you pass the initial wisdom check, the full party is restored to full health from inspiring hike. |

###### Lake:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Landmark** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Sunken Catacomb | An *[[Dungeon Tables\|undead, flooded dungeon]]*, located at the edge of a huge lake. After 10 turns exploring the dungeon, it begins to flood more extremely, filling up from the entrance to whatever room the party is in at a rate of 2 rooms per turn. In a fully flooded room, the party takes 1d4 damage from drowning as they move through it. |
| 2 | Precarious Bridges | A set of rickety bridges criss-cross a giant bridge. The party is ambushed by 1d4 *[[Master Enemy List|Fish Freaks]]*, and find one *[[Loot Tables\|elemental: water weapon]]* if they defeat them rather than run. |
| 3 | Guarded Barge | At least 2 party members must pass a conversation related wis test, or everyone is refused entry on the one boat that can take them across the region wide lake. Return to the previous hex on fail, continue as normal if pass. |
| 4 | Writhing Village | A village of squid people (actually tiny 2d6 *[[Master Enemy List|eldritch creatures]]*). The party as if they are in the capital here and/or [[Character Rules\|level up]] as usual. Just before leaving, the wisest party member must pass a conversation related wisdom check at disadvantage or fight the squids, who reveal their true forms and attack. |
#### **Biome Specific NPCs:**

###### Hills:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Wandering Halfing | The party encounters a wandering halfling in tattered, clothes, who begs the party to help him find a ring that he has lost. If the party has a ring, they can give it to him and the highest *wis* character must pass a wis check. If they pass, the halfling believes it is the true ring and blesses them: 1 party member gains a level. If they fail the *wis* test, the halfing attacks the party, but if killed drops a *magical weapon*. |
| 2 | Witch on a Hill | A witch on top of a hill. The witch will *curse* the party member with the highest strength in the party, swapping that number with their lowest ability score. |
| 3 | Polymorphed Druid | The party encounters a druid, seemingly permanently polymorphed into a sheep. He will join the party--as a sheep--if the highest wis party member succeeds on a check. It is possible to un-polymorph him if the party finds the means. |
| 4 | The Priest of the Hills | An uptight, justice-obsessed priest, who considers the hills to be a domain under his protection. Using a truth-compulsion spell, the priest attempts to force the party to tell him anything bad they have done. All party members must make a wis check, and if they fail must tell him of their misdeeds. Depending on how bad they are (determined by previous actions in campaign; flavor), the priest might smite the character down, attack the party, demand flagellation (2d4 damage), or give the party bad advice, making them *lost*. |

###### Plains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Cartographer of the Flatlands | Encounter a cartographer. Roll 1d4: that many hexes around the current hex have their biomes (and nothing else) rolled and established. |
| 2 | Stranded Composer | The party hears music from miles away, follow the sound, and find a stranded composer. The composer asks to join the party until they reach a settlement or the capital. If the party accepts, a character who does nothing but 1d4 damage per round and has 6 health joins the party. If you succeed in bringing the composer to a settlement or capital, he gives the party 500 gold and a *magical instrument*. |
| 3 | Man-Mole | The party encounters a huge mole person, who is willing to show the party to an *underdark dungeon* in exchange for 3 days of rations. |
| 4 | Plains Pirates | The party encounters a boat of plains pirates. If the most charismatic (highest wis) character succeeds on a charisma check, the pirates will transport the party to any hex up to 2 away from current hex. If they fail, the party is shaken down, losing 2 random items and up to 50g. If the party wants to try and fight off the pirates, they can, but it is a difficult fight (2d6 pirates), though they receive 2 *magical items*. |

###### Mountains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Mountain Stalker | The party is stalked by a silent figure. The party rolls to see if they notice (full party wis check, 2/4 passes). If they fail, they are robbed for up to 50g. If they pass, they can either kill the spy (who wont put up a fight) and loot his body--roll 1d4 random items--or spare him. If you spare him, make one more full party wis check, on 2/4 pass: he joins the party (randomly rolled rogue). |
| 2 | Cliffside Merchant | The party encounters a weird merchant, hidden away in a cliffside pass. He has 1d4 random *magic items* for sale, each valued at 100g. |
| 3 | Ghost of the Crags | The party is haunted by a ghost, who will follow them until they enter another Mountain biome. While the ghost is following the party, they get disadvantage on checks relating to anything religious, but gain advantage on all checks related to intimidating someone. |
| 4 | Exiled Prince | The party encounters an exiled prince, who offers the party great riches if they escort him back to *the capital*. If the party lets him join, a standard *civilian* joins the party, and upon arriving at the capital, roll on a oracle dice to see if he follows through with his promise or not. If he does, the party gains 500g, or a random new character joins the party, a sworn knight rendered to your service. |

###### Forest:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Desperate Hero | The party encounters a clearing in the forest with a sword-in-the-stone set up in the middle. Someone seems to be trying to shove the sword *back into* the rock, though. Desperate to put a cursed sword back in the stone, the hero asks for the party's help--2+ successful str checks will get the sword back in. If 2+ do not pass, then the weakest party member is forced to carry the *cursed sword*, which reduces their maximum hp by 1d4 but does 1d8 damage. No matter what, the hero bounds off into the forest. |
| 2 | Guerrilla Leader | The party finds the injured leader of a force of guerrilla fighters protecting the forest as theier homeland. The party can heal the leader if they have any means of doing so--if they chose not to he will die. If the party heals the leader and lets him go, then the guerrilla force will come to help the party at some point in the future (no real rules on how to incorporate this, just make a note and have it happen when appropriate). |
| 3 | The Green Child | The party finds a green child, alone in the forest. They can allow the child to join them (a civilian with 1 health). If the party keeps the child alive for 5 days, it will transform into a massive forest elemental, joining the party. If the child dies at any point during those 5 days, he explodes in a hail of thorns and deals 1d4 damage to everyone in the party at that moment. |
| 4 | The Drowned Knight | In the middle of the forest, the party encounters the body of a knight, who seems to have drowned, despite no body of water being nearby. If the party has a way of healing the knight (a revive spell or something similar, something that might dry him out intensely), the knight wakes. If the knight wakes, he challenges the party to a fight: if he is reduced to close 50% health he will offer the party his *magical sword* and run off. |

###### Desert:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Paladin of the Sun | A paladin wandering through the desert offers to bless the party. He appears to be dying of thirst. Depending on an oracle roll, he will either die when blessing the party or not. If he dies you can loot his corpse for a *magical weapon*; if he lives he will give the players a *magical key*.  |
| 2 | Apocalypse Priest | A violent priest who wants to destroy the world. If 2+ party members succeed on a wis check, you convince him to join the party, with the intent of protecting him and keeping him from destroying the world. The party gains a cleric who will betray them and attack in 1d6 days. If you do not succeed on the wis check in the first place, he runs off, leaving the party *tired* from the encounter. |
| 3 | Explosive Treasure Hunter | The party encounters a speculator who claims that the desert they are in is home to an unimaginable source of wealth, located underground. He explains to the party that he is going to blow up a certain party of the desert to expose the treasure beneath. If the party tries to stop him, he throws explosives at the party and runs away after two turns of combat: 2+ dex check to avoid 1d4 damage. If the party lets him go or he escapes, the hex becomes a *sinkhole* after the party leaves. |
| 4 | The Enraptured | The party encounters a poet, who falls desperately in love with the party member with the highest dexterity. The poet will write on poem about the character per day, and if the player actually writes 4-6 lines of poetry about that party member that day, they gain 1d6 temporary hit points. If the character who the enraptured is in love with dies, he goes over the deep end attacks the rest of the party, with the statblock of a *berserker*. |

###### Tundra:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Ice-preserved Treasure Hunter | An old, old woman, wizened and wrinkled, who has spent her life--a long life--searching the tundra for treasure. The snow storm and the magical frozen winds have preserved her body and kept her functioning but also confused her sense of space, time, and reality. When the party finds her, she offers to sell them two *random* *magic items* for 100g each. If the party buys one or both, she follows them because she knows they have money. Roll an oracle roll to see if the party notices her, and play out the scenario however you see fit. If the woman is killed, she'll have 1d4 *ice elemental magic items* on her but if anyone uses any of those items will become *[[Status Conditions\|frozen]]* every morning daily until a curse on them is lifted (they thaw after a few hours, but are *slowed* until they fully thaw). If the curse is not lifted, the character will wander off the next time the party is in a Tundra. |
| 2 | Frozen Grave Digger | The party encounters a humorless, nearly skeletal man, digging graves in a frozen over graveyard. He explains to the party that he must always dig because it takes so long to dig a grave in the frozen region that he must be ready for any unexpected deaths. If the party can help him in any way he will be extremely greatful, giving the strongest party member his special shovel, which is actually a [[Loot Tables\|Unique Firey Great-Axe]]. |
| 3 | Boreal Falconer | The party encounters a traditional falconer who is able to control a unique, all white [[Master Enemy List|Dire Falcon]]. The party can try to recruit the falconer, kill him and take the falcon, try to gain training from him, or let him go. Determine rolls to go in any of these directions, but should have to make checks for whatever it is you try and do. |
| 4 | Archivist of the Ice | The party encounters a wandering scholar, who walks around gathering samples of ice from around the world. The party can either give him ice if they have some, promise to bring him back samples, or try to buy some of his wares. If you try to buy things from him, he will sell 3 *random magic items* for 100g each, but each item will melt into nothingness after 1d8+1 days, to be determined after sale. |

###### Canyon:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The Scout | A scout, hidden somewhere in the mountains. The party either stumbles upon them and surprise them or the scout spies on them for a time before revealing themself--wis check related to perception to see which way it goes. If you find the scout, they will offer you a unique item if you let him go: a *magical cape* that allows the wearer to move invisibly through rocky, canyony areas. If the scout sneaks up on the party, them will try to demand they pay 100g to pass, or they (and their implied companions) will kill the party. The party can respond how they see fit and make the appropriate rolls. |
| 2 | Cliffside Herbalist | An herbalist who is after special herbs that only grow on the vertical walls of the canyon. They are currently in trouble, hanging desperate from the side of the cliff. They will fall in 1d4+1 turns--the party has that many turns to try to save them, making appropriate checks with appropriate equipment. If the party succeeds, he gifts them a *magical healing potion* which miraculously refills and can thus be reused once per day. |
| 3 | Earthworker | A magician who has chosen to live her life as an earthwork sculptor, using her powers to carve huge artworks in the sides of canyons and out of towering rock spires. If the party succeeds in convincing her that her powers are best used elsewhere (combination of checks, context, and oracle rolls), she will join the party. Otherwise, she will be inspired by the physically weakest party member and begin carving a giant sculpture of them, which will be finished the next time the party visits this hex. |
| 4 | Exiled Underking | A wandering dwarf who claims to be the exiled queen of an underground dwarven kingdom beneath the canyon. She asks for the party to help her to get to a secret entrance to the kingdom, which in game terms is a *[[Dungeon Tables\|Geologically Fantastic Underdark Dungeon]]* located in the same hex, the final room of which will have a secret door into the kingdom. If the party succeeds in bringing the queen here, she will reward them with a *magic key* that will open 3 doors before breaking in addition to a random *unique magical weapon*, which should be rolled and given a name and backstory. |

###### Lake:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **NPC** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Lad of the Lake | A small boy emerges from the deep section of the lake as the party takes a boat across. He offers to guide the party across the rest of the lake, and if they accept there is a 50/50 chance he will guide them back to where they began, and the hex encounter must be rerolled. If the party refuses his help he decides to haunt them, reappearing the next time the party is in a lake hex and causes them to immediately get lost. |
| 2 | The Saboteur | As they cross a huge dam, the party encounters a saboteur trying to destroy the dam and flood the nearby region. The party can help them, stop them, or let them proceed, however they see fit, rolling appropriate checks and oracle rolls. If the dam is sabotaged, a random hex adjacent to the lake also *becomes a lake*. |
| 3 | Ark Builder | The party encounters a woman building a huge ark. She claims that the lakey region will soon flood the rest of the world and only those on her ark will survive. The party can try and convince the woman her talents would be helpful elsewhere, and if they succeed she will go to [[Hex Rules\|The Capital]] and boat-building will become available there. If the party lets her continue, whenever anyone returns to this hex it will be a newly *Fertile Plains*, repopulated and renatured by the ark builder and those she brought about her ark. If the party convinces her to leave or otherwise stops her project, if anyone ever returns to this hex it will be a *Flooded Sinkhole* (with a *[[Dungeon Tables\|flooded underdark]]* dungeon entrance). |
| 4 | Lakeside Magician | The party encounters a magician, working on her spells lakeside. The magician claims that there is a dungeon entrance beneath the lake, and offers to dry it up in return for 500g. If the party takes her up on her offer, the hex becomes a desert and the party finds an entrance to a *Ancient Water Elemental Dungeon*. |

#### **Biome Specific Events:**

###### Hills:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Iconoclasts | The party encounters a stonehenge like ruin, in the process of being destroyed by a group of iconoclasts (1d6 [[Master Enemy List|bandits]]). The party can try and stop them through discussion or violence (make appropriate checks, run appropriate combat), or can let them go about the destruction. If you let them destroy the ruins, after they leave you find in the rubble the entrance to an *[[Dungeon Tables\|Ultra-Dark Secret Lair]]*, but the next time you enter a [[Settlement Rules|settlement]], everything will cost 50% more because the people heard that you let it happen. If you stop the bandits, you do not discover the secret lair.  |
| 2 | Infinitely Climbing Hills | The party enters a supernatural space where the hills keep climbing and climbing. The hex becomes *Dangerous Mountains* and the party must reroll for another encounter. |
| 3 | Grazing Horde | The party is surrounded by a horde of grazing creatures of a kind theyve never seen. If the party disturbs any of the creatures (2+ successful dex checks needed), they will charge, and the party takes 1d4 damage each as they are run out of the hex. If the party succeeds in moving through the horde, the creatures remember and the hex will always be easily passable and not require an encounter roll.  |
| 4 | A Fortress Under Construction | The party encounters a fortress being built in the middle of the hills by a huge group of enslaved laborers. 1d6+1 [[Master Enemy List|Elite Soldiers]] guard the laborers and keep them in check. The party can respond to this situation however they want, but if they let the fortress be built there will be an established military settlement in the hex the next time a party moves through. |

###### Plains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Stampede of Plains Jellyfish | The party is faced with a stampede of [[Master Enemy List|Plains Jellyfish]]. They come in such large numbers that the party has no way of defeating them in combat. Instead, you must hide (dex), dodge (dex), or find some other means (magical or otherwise) of evading the jellyfish, or all party members take 1d4 damage. |
| 2 | Turf War | The party crests a slight hill and are faced with a wide plain, where, as far as the eye can see, some kind of battle is taking place between different sorts of creatures (randomize three enemy types based on [[Creature and Combat Tables|Plains enemy table]]). The party can only watch the battle take place: do oracle rolls to see who wins the battle. In the aftermath, the party can wander through the battlfield, and will find one beast part usable as a *magical weapon* (flavored as a beast part) if the highest wis party member succeeds on a wis-perception check. |
| 3 | Tower Ransacking | The party finds the entrance to a *[[Dungeon Tables\|Picked-Over Wizards Tower]]* which is currently being looted by 1d6+1 bandits. The party can either wait for the looting to end and then head into the dungeon, ignore the situation completely, or stop the ransacking and find two random *magic items* among the bandits' loot. |
| 4 | Funeral Procession | The party encounters a funeral procession of hundreds of people and creatures of all shapes and sizes. The party can either ignore the procession or choose to join it (if they pass 2+ wis/charisma checks), in which case the procession heals the party to full health and levels up one character as they cross into the next hex. If you try to join the procession and fail, the party becomes Confused for the next two days. |

###### Mountains:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The Sermon in the Mount | The party follows a crowd of robed people to a cave in the side of a mountain, where a sermon is underway. The preacher is a *[[Master Enemy List|mimic]]*, presenting itself in its honest form--a pile of meat and bile--exhorting its followers to go destroy a nearby settlement. If the party has some means of stopping the sermon without causing the crowd to turn on them--or believe they can escape--they can try that. Otherwise, the sermon will likely succeed, and the next hex will include a [[Settlement Tables|settlement]] that will be destroyed after the party visits it once. If the party succeeds in stopping the sermon, they will find the same settlement, but it will not be destroyed. |
| 2 | Psychic Quake | The party feels that they experience a huge earthquake, and fall of cliffs unless they succeed on 2+ wis/dex checks. Characters with dex as their highest attribute may roll a dex check instead. If the party does not fall off the cliff, they realize they went through something in their heads, and one random character gains the *[[Character Tables\|Open-Minded]]* personality trait. |
| 3 | Giantseed Burial | At the top of a mountain, the party encounters a group of 1d6+1 *[[Master Enemy List|acolytes]]* in the process of burying the heart of a mountain giant. The party can choose to let the burial go on or stop it. If they allow it to succeed, the region becomes *volcanic*. If they stop the burial, they can take the heart and use it to turn a different region, at any future point, into a volcano. |
| 4 | Gods' Game | The party encounters a region where the mountains seem to be moving around at random. If they chose to just try and move through, they become tired and must roll another encounter roll. If they have any sort of magic that lets them see magical or invisible things, the party sees that the mountains are being moved by the giant hands of gods. If anyone notices this, you can move through the space as usual, and the highest wis character gains the [[Character Tables\|Happy]] personality trait. |

###### Forest:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Steam Devil Wedding | The party happens upon a wedding of two steam devils deep in the forest. It is a destination wedding; the happy couple and all of their guests are from hell. If anyone int he party is *friendly* or if the highest wis character passes a wis check, the party can join the wedding party. They spend the rest of the night carousing and partying, and wake int he morning with all signs of the wedding gone besides that the highest wis character has learned the spell *Smoke Cloud*. If the party doesnt join the party or isn't allowed to, they are simply shooed away. |
| 2 | Haze of Forgiveness | The party finds a section of the forest teeming with people from all walks of life, wandering around a hazy region. If you stop and speak to anyone, they tell you that you are in the presence of the Haze of Forgiveness--a supernatural presence that, if breathed properly and for an extended period, can apparently bring people a deep sort of emotional piece and achieve a profound understanding of forgiveness. If the party stays in the haze, roll wis check for all characters. If they pass, they gain the *relaxed* personality trait, if they fail they gain anxious. No matter what, the party becomes *lost* and must roll another encounter in the same hex. |
| 3 | The Parliament of Trees | The party encounters the legendary Parliament of Trees: a group of ancient, sentient trees who adjudicate many of the questions of justice that arise in the natural world (it is a deep misunderstanding that there is no justice in nature). The party can ask the trees one yes or no question, which will be answered with an oracle roll. If one party member wants to, they can stay with the parliament, and, if a party ever returns to the hex, they may rejoin the party, and will be *two levels higher*, have grown antlers, and gained the *Judgmental* personality trait. |
| 4 | Sylvan Spy Network | The party is ambushed by members of the Sylvan Spy Network. They have been watching the party since they entered the region and decided to jump the party when they determined that they were indeed hunting for dungeons and treasure. The spy network will threaten to kill the party: you can either fight them (1d4+1 *elven rangers*, a *dire fox*) or try to convince them not to fight. If you are able to parlay, the spy network will tell you where else they can be located so that you wont be ambushed again: choose one random hex 1d4 hexes away from current hex, that hex is now a *Historical Forest*. The spy network will check in with the party again there.   |

###### Desert:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Divine Cleaners | The party enters a strange region where the sand of the desert appears to have been scraped and swept away to expose the rock below.  Eventually they encounter a group of hooded figures, stooped over brooms, pushing, all together, a huge mount sand and dirt that moved slowly before them. If you chose to approach, one of the figures tells you they are priests of the god of cleanliness, for whom cleanliness is not next to godliness but coincident with it. They are in the process, they explain, of cleaning the world: this desert is dirty, and it must be swept clean. The cleaners offer no aid to the characters besides giving on of them a broom (a *normal club*), which will--if used as a weapon--leave no trace of combat behind it. If the party decides to try to stop the cleaners for some reason, they will come to each others defense (2d6+5 *civilians*) but ultimately run away if the party kills or disables a large number of them. If you let them clean and ever return to this hex, it will be completely barren and lifeless, and will no longer require a encounter roll to pass through. (Optional rule: move the cleaners to a different random hex next to the original one when you move in: the same process will happen there, they will continue until stopped) |
| 2 | Dust Devil Cult | I swirling whirlwind of dust and sand cuts through the wilderness at high speed; a crowd of 2d6 *cultists* chase after the storm, sprinting through the desert. The runners--a cult who believe chasing whirlwinds will lead them to a secret utopia--will not stop for the players, but the players can join the chase (if they do not nothing happens). If the party joins the chase, if 2+ characters succeed on a dexterity check you find a *[[Settlement Tables\|prosperous settlement]]*, otherwise hidden in the desert. After doing whatever they do at the settlement, the party will be attacked by a *[[Master Enemy List\|dust devil]]*. |
| 3 | Blinding Winds | A magical wind blows through the desert, blinding the party. If the party choses to move on, they get *lost* unless 3+ characters pass wis or dex checks and have to roll another encounter. That night, though, every character has a dream, and learns a [[Character Tables\|randomly generated spell]], which they can each use once. If the party choses to stop moving in the wind, they can move on the next day freely, but nobody has a vision. |
| 4 | Grand Mirage | The party experiences a collective mirage: a biome specific landmark from a randomly picked biome appears before them. Follow all directions for that landmark.  |

###### Tundra:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Parents of the Lost | The players encounter a massive group of wailing, grieving parents, who all claim to have had a child lost to some tundra, somewhere. The players may join the procession; if they do, one random character becomes *[[Character Tables\|depressed]]* and the party is lead to a *secret lair*, home to 2d6 *[[Master Enemy List\|zombies]]* rather than a strong enemy. |
| 2 | Thawfire | The party slowly realize that all of the ice around them is thawing and becoming burning hot steam. The party must pass 2+ str checks or fall into a crevasse made by a quick thaw, taking 1d4 damage each. No matter what happens with the party, the hex will be a *Lake* the next time the party visits. |
| 3 | The Frozen Nobility | A circle of chairs facing each other at the top of a freezing hill in the tundra. In each chair there is a person dressed nobily, frozen solid. If the party has any way of safely thawing them, one party member gains a level for free, but the party has to fight 1d4 *[[Master Enemy List\|elemental undead nobles]]*. |
| 4 | Preserved Wizard | The party encounters a wizard, perfectly preserved in ice. They simply join the party (as a randomly rolled level 2 wizard), and offer no explanation as to what happened to them or how they got frozen. The wizard melts after five days have passed. |
###### Canyon:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The Sunken Philosopher | The party hears someone pontificating, echoing through the canyon. Eventually, they find a person in a deep hole at the bottom of a canyon, who seems to be speaking to themselves. If the party just lets them speak and listen, the highest wisdom character becomes *[[Character Tables\|open minded]]*. If the party interrupts the scholar, they will attack, and not stop attacking unless killed, but will drop two random *magic scrolls* on death. |
| 2 | Century Swarm | The party passes through a tunnel between crags, and notice the walls are covered in small, sleeping bugs. If 2+ characters don't pass dex checks, the swarm is awoken. If the swarm awakes, the party takes 1d4 damage and the canyon becomes permanently *impassable*. If the swarm is not awoken, nothing happens. |
| 3 | Infinite Cliff | An infinitely tall cliff rises above the party as they try to maneuver through the bottom of a canyon. Unless the party has some means of magically climbing the cliff, they must turn back, returning to the previous hex *tired*. The cliff is not there the next time they pass through, however, so you can immediately re-enter the hex and roll another encounter. |
| 4 | Pacifying Pass | The party passes through an impossibly beautiful canyon, and are rendered pacifist. For the next 2 days, the party cannot fight, and must run from any combat encounter. All characters who survive the 2 days lose and gain a random personality trait, befuddled by the experience and changed deeply. |
###### Lake:

| **Roll (1d4)** | **Event** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Lake of Spirits | A lake of alcoholic spirits. The party becomes drunk and *lost*, rerolling for a new encounter and all gaining a one time-use random *[[Character Tables\|martial ability]]*.  |
| 2 | Golden Pools | The party enters a region of many small lakes, each of which glow strangely because of the layer of gold coins that cover their bottom. If the party wants to try and retrieve some of the gold, each party member who tries must make a wis check: on pass they gain 25g, on fail they take 1d4 damage from the suddenly acidic water, which rejects, branding them *greedy* (they gain that personality trait). If you chose to throw more than 100g into the pool, one party member gains the *giving* trait. |
| 3 | Bloodpools | A region dotted with small pools of blood, which seem to seep out of endless springs in the ground. The party must roll 2+ wis checks or else become *[[Status Conditions\|sickened]]*. Any party member may choose to bath in a bloody pool: they take 1d6 damage but if they survive gain 1d4 permanent extra hit points. |
| 4 | Knights of the Lake | The party encounters a group of knights, training in combat waist deep in water. If the highest wis party member succeeds on a check, the party may train with the nights and from then on gain advantage when in a *lake biome* or any *flooded biome or dungeon*. If the check fails, the knights force each party member deep under the water, nearly drowning them: the party wakes *back in the capital*. |
#### Biome Specific Creatures:
