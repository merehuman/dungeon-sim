Roll,NPCType,Effect
1,WanderingHalfling,The party encounters a wandering halfling in tattered, clothes, who begs the party to help him find a ring that he has lost. If the party has a ring, they can give it to him and the highest wis character must pass a wis check. If they pass, the halfling believes it is the true ring and blesses them: 1 party member gains a level. If they fail the wis test, the halfing attacks the party, but if killed drops a magical weapon
2,WitchOnHill,A witch on top of a hill. The witch will curse the party member with the highest strength in the party, swapping that number with their lowest ability score
3,PolymorphedDruid,The party encounters a druid, seemingly permanently polymorphed into a sheep. He will join the party--as a sheep--if the highest wis party member succeeds on a check. It is possible to un-polymorph him if the party finds the means
4,PriestOfHills,An uptight, justice-obsessed priest, who considers the hills to be a domain under his protection. Using a truth-compulsion spell, the priest attempts to force the party to tell him anything bad they have done. All party members must make a wis check, and if they fail must tell him of their misdeeds. Depending on how bad they are (determined by previous actions in campaign; flavor), the priest might smite the character down, attack the party, demand flagellation (2d4 damage), or give the party bad advice, making them lost
