1,MountainStalker,The party is stalked by a silent figure. The party rolls to see if they notice (full party wis check, 2/4 passes). If they fail, they are robbed for up to 50g. If they pass, they can either kill the spy (who wont put up a fight) and loot his body--roll 1d4 random items--or spare him. If you spare him, make one more full party wis check, on 2/4 pass: he joins the party (randomly rolled rogue)

3,GhostOfCrags,The party is haunted by a ghost, who will follow them until they enter another Mountain biome. While the ghost is following the party, they get disadvantage on checks relating to anything religious, but gain advantage on all checks related to intimidating someone
4,ExiledPrince,The party encounters an exiled prince, who offers the party great riches if they escort him back to the capital. If the party lets him join, a standard civilian joins the party, and upon arriving at the capital, roll on a oracle dice to see if he follows through with his promise or not. If he does, the party gains 500g, or a random new character joins the party, a sworn knight rendered to your service
