Roll,LandmarkType,Effect
1,EchoingChapel,A chapel in the center of an open frozen tundra, filled with howling winds. At the center of the chapel is the frozen body of an undead elemental saint. The party can try and get him to join the party (make a character sheet), or if they defeat him they can loot his body for two elemental loot items
2,CrystallineTheater,An outdoor theater made entirely of a lightly glowing hard crystal. The party can sit in the stands and will hallucinate a future event, placing a dungeon entrance in a random hex up 1d4 distance from the theater. After the hallucination fades, the characters may either fight the suddenly hostile stone zombies and find one piece of random loot or run away to the next hex
3,ShiveringTrail,The party seems to be lost before realizing that they can follow a path ahead of them which can't be seen but is instead felt as a massive negative change in temperature. The party can stay on the path taking 1d4 cold damage and moving on to the next hex or can roll again on the encounter table and not take the damage
4,RestlessGlacier,An enormous, football field sized glacier, which moves extremely fast (for a glacier). It seems to follow the party, slowing their progress: roll for a second encounter; the characters are frozen for the first round of that encounter, if it is combat. Because of the hugeness of the glacier and its seemingly magical following of the party, the next hex is also a tundra
