#### **General Notes:**

- Should be made up of two main elements: A **Hexcrawl** system and a **Dungeon Crawl** system
- To make those work, need to be able to generate/run **characters, quests, cities, combat**
- Will need to make/find pages to draw the hex crawl, a page for dungeon making, character/party sheet
- A principle: want to have my party die a la 12 years frequently - should be a “rogue like” almost where I start new parties constantly - a goal for balance should be figuring out ways to make it actually dangerous and challenging while also letting me sometimes succeed
- Character rules can be very flexible - these will likely change the most - I know what kind of hex crawling and dungeon crawling (and, to a lesser extent, city/quest/combat styles) I like - I can make the character system fit to those kinds of play, rather than establishing rules for character then trying to make those work for me - in general I should be putting what I like to do ahead of rules particularities - remember the idea that freedom and power of play doesn’t necessarily come from more rules
- Want to make **“open” and “closed” versions of the game** - one that I can play like 12 years with nothing but a booklet designed for the purpose of play (i.e., a set of random tables and a simple set of rules that, together, create gameplay) - and the other a “open” version that will make use of other materials to provide structure and detail for any and all parts of gameplay
- For _play materials_, I will need: a _hexcrawl sheet_ (inc. spaces for notes on hexes), a _dungeon crawl sheet_ (inc. spaces for notes on rooms), _character sheets_ (inc. space for character interactions/party notes), and various _tracking apparatus_ (effects/notes/time tracking, etc).
- Also an option: the hex crawl and dungeon crawl sheets can include necessary trackers: camp supplies/rations, torches, turn tracker (six sector circle, dice roll on sixth spot)
- Consider adding a table for something like "campaign modifier", or "campaign context" - can be things like encroaching war, region wide natural disasters, etc - things that would impact my party at in mostly indirect ways
- Related to above - I need to roll an overall quest or situation to give it the shape of a campaign, a la 12 years. Finding multiple particular items could work, or shepherding a single item through a series of challenges - the campaign structure could be activating 3 magical pylons that will open up some dungeon in the capital - can roll to place those and attach quests/combat challenges to each one

#### **Hex Notes:**

- Need 6-10 distinct biomes - either randomly roll each hex or it depends on what hex you are in what you get next
- Within that - large encounter table - maybe a d10 table to determine what kind of encounter (various likelihoods), and then 6 d12 tables with particular encounters
- Possible encounter types:
	- Architectural/Cultural Discovery (includes dungeon entrances)
	- Natural Discovery/Event
	- Combat
	- NPC
	- Personal/Interpersonal Party Event
	- City/Settlement
- Need weather tables for each biome - these should impact the encounter table results (i.e., results will say: if it is raining, this happens in addition/instead)
- Part of hex-crawl sheet needs to be trackers for rations

#### **Dungeon Crawl Notes:**

- Need tables for generating random rooms, encounters, loot
- Room generation: should come up with size, shape, exits, type of room (rectilinear, round, hallway, etc), details, inhabitants,
- How size could matter: can effect how combat encounters go: in hallways you get disadvantage if the character is big, in a big room rangers have advantage because of long range shots, but there can be larger groups of enemies, in small rooms AOE will hit party members in big rooms it will not, etc.
- One thing for corridors: only front 2 chars can attack, same for enemies, unless ranged
- How shape could matter: could effect line of site in combat, difficulty of finding secret doors, types of traps that are possible
- Elements of exits that have to be generated: number, where they go (up/down, out of dungeon, to another room), whether or not they are secret, whether or not they are locked/blocked
- Need to be able to generate the theme of a dungeon from the outset (i.e., a cave, a castle, a ruin, etc.) - though most things will be shared across dungeon type each will have a few particular differences on the tables (i.e, rolling a 12 could get you…castle: a throne room; ruin: a perfectly intact room, cave: a rushing underwater river)
- Encounter Types could be similar to hex crawl encounter types, minus city/settlement, plus trap, dungeon theme particular encounters
- Should function on a “turns” system, i.e.: every time you do something significant it takes 10 minutes - part of making the dungeon sheet needs to be that it includes trackers for turns, torches, etc.

#### **Character Notes:**

- Combine 12 years, 4AD, and Maze Rats/Knave to create a character generator and character sheets
- Should be classes, races, basic stats (3 or 6?) - most likely _3_, and will just be vague about bonuses (i.e., +1 when you are arguing with somebody, instead of “on charisma checks”)
- 1 “special ability” or spell per character (per level?)
- Health determined by HD of a class - +1 health per level except particular class that gains +2
- Need equipment system: 3 slots? Common sense approach (can’t use multiple two handed weapons/multiple pairs of gloves etc.) - weapons should effect more than damage dice
- Encumbrance system - number of inventory slots equals Str

#### **Quest Notes:**

- Tome of Adventure Design best for this - in “open” version of game I’ll basically use that, in “closed” version I’ll make smaller version of the tables in that book
- Need a quest tracker page - easily formatted so that you can see the relevant info about a quest (quest giver/location, known relevant locations/hexes, time pressure tracker, reward)

#### **Settlement Notes:**

#### **Loot, Items, and Equipment Notes:**

- Two possible approaches - can do both: tables of particular items and tables that create items (a la 12 years, Maze Rats spells)

#### **Combat Notes:**

- Possible approaches (can be used in combination): 5e, 12 years, 4AD
- I like the 12 years system of D6 determining how an entire round goes - I could borrow that system then make it slightly more complex — allow spells, use of abilities, etc.
- Need a magic system - easiest would be to generate spells and then determine what they do (a la Maze Rats)
- Could make a martial attack system similar to maze rats magic - i.e., you determine what kind of “special move” you can do on a table - can use once per combat encounter/dungeon/hex - easiest is to determine what the attack does through combination of type/target - (Use common sense in relation to damage: if strong effect, low damage)
- A general rule: if something asks you to “roll twice” and you roll that number again, disregard it and reroll
- For enemy stat blocks: hp, hi save, lo save, damage die, special abilities/notes

#### Playtesting notes 
- need to figure out how attacks work - is there a roll to hit, or do you just do damage? if you do - how to handle damage mitigation besides armor
- Solution: use demon lord d6 attack system, but at any moment character can opt out of the team roll to use an ability/spell - then - no AC needed - just need a way to determine who enemies hit
#### Play Materials Notes
- [x] Need to add "total GP" and "chosen personality bonuses" to character sheet page
- [x] Remake it as a two page spread so i can add custom things along the bottom/in middle etc
- [x] Need space for status effects (same as inventory?)
