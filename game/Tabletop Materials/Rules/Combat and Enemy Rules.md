#### Combat Procedure:

*Before combat:*
1. Roll on appropriate creature table to determine encounter
2. Roll for creature behavior

*During Combat*:
1. Roll attack roll
2. Cast spells (party, creature or both depending on attack roll)
3. Roll damage
4. Determine targets (all damage can be distributed freely, but cannot be divided between targets)
5. Note new health values
6. Start new combat round
#### Rules:

**Advantage**: An attack roll at advantage automatically deals a critical hit (x2 damage) on all hits. This is the only way to deal a critical when *duel wielding*.

**Attack Roll:** A d6, rolled at the start of each round, which determines how combat plays out during that round. See *Creature and Combat Tables* for details.

**Armor:** A score that each party member has: reduce any damage done to that party member by that number.

**Cleave:** Extra damage from attacks passes to remaining enemies/party members

**Critical Hit:** If you roll a 6 on the combat die, your attacks deal double damage.

**Damage Roll**: A dice roll determined by the enemy type, weapon, spell, or ability. Whatever the results of the roll, that amount of damage is done, minus the targets *armor*.

**Disadvantage**: An attack roll at disadvantage automatically deals a glancing blow (1/2 damage) on all hits.

**Duel Wield:** Always roll damage for both weapon attacks, but cannot *crit* unless attacking with *advantage*.

**Glancing Blow**: A 3 and 4 on the combat die both indicate glancing blows, dealing 1/2 damage (3 just creatures hit, 4 creature+party).

**Fleeing Combat:** To flee combat, 2+ party members must pass a *DEX* check. If you fail, you still get to attack that round, but cannot try to flee until the next round.

**_One-Handed (1h):_** Takes one hand slot to wield.

**_Two-Handed (2h):_** Takes two hand slots to wield.

**_Ranged:_** When equipped, cannot be hit by enemy glancing blows (3 on the attack die; still struck for 1/2 damage on a 4).

**_Sneaky:_** When equipped, also glancing hit on enemy glancing blow (3 on the attack die)

**_Throwable:_** Can be thrown at an enemy on an enemy glancing blow (3). The weapon is then lost but automatically retrieved after battle.
