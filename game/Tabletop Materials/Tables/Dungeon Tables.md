| 14-15           | Underdark         | Dungeon exits lead to any hex up to 3 hexes away.

| 20              | The Forecamp      | A 1 room dungeon, guarded by _a keeper_. If they are defeated, the tunnel in the Forecamp can be used to move back to The Capital at will. Only one Forecamp may exist on the hexmap at a time; if a new Forecamp is discovered the previous tunnel collapses. When you defeat the _keeper_, you also receive one Forecamp specific loot item. |     |
_Note: In addition to all of the effects listed, you roll on the corresponding encounter and enemy tables when appropriate._

#### **Dungeon Modifiers:**

| **Roll (1d20)** | **Modifier** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1-5 | None | No effect. |
| 6-8 | Trapped | Every second room explored (starting with Room 2) is _trapped_. |
| 9-10 | Geologically Fantastic | A crystalline cavern, a castle made of some special dark stone, etc. All enemies are _made of stone_ and all of the loot is at least _Standard_ (on 1-12_,_ but also _Heavy_. |
| 11-12 | Evil | The place has an overwhelming aura of evil. All healing in this dungeon is reduced by 1/2. |
| 13 | Ancient | Because the space is so ancient, all loot there is _Flimsy_ on rolls 1-13 but _Unique_ on 15-17. |
| 14 | Labyrinthine | A system of tubes. _Room Type_ is always coridor, and the first room must have at least 3 exits. Because it is hard to get around these spaces, the loot found there is always at least _Standard_ (on a 1-12). |
| 15 | Picked-Over | Any loot found cannot be _Exceptional_, _Ornate_, or _Unique_ (reroll), but if you explore fifteen rooms you find one _Magic_ item. |
| 16 | Flooded | The dungeon is filled with waist-deep water. Moving from one room to another takes _two turns_, electric attacks do double damage, and any non-magical paper loot found is useless and worthless. |
| 17 | Ultra-Dark | Only party members with _darkvision_ can see properly; torches do nothing to help. |
| 18 | Seething with Enemies | Anytime an enemy is rolled, 2x that enemy shows up instead. |
| 19 | Bountiful | Anytime loot is rolled, roll twice and take both. |
| 20 | Roll Twice | Roll twice on this table and combine the results. |
