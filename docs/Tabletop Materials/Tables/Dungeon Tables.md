| 7-9             | Monster Den       | All characters are _[[Status Conditions\|poisoned]]_ by the smell of the den while inside.                                                                                                                                                                           |     |

| 12-13           | Wizard’s Tower    | All traps deal +1d6 magical damage, and any _exceptional, ornate_, or _unique_ items are instead considered _magical_. All rooms are manmade                                                                                                                         |     |
| 14-15           | Underdark         | Dungeon exits lead to any hex up to 3 hexes away. Torches diminish at twice the normal rate.                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| 16              | Fae-Touched       | All magic loot and all creatures are Fae-Touched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |

| 18              | Elemental         | Roll on the random element table. All magic loot and all creatures are modified by that element.                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

| 6-8             | Trapped                | Every second room explored (starting with Room 2) contains a *trap*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9-10            | Geologically Fantastic | A crystalline cavern, a castle made of some special dark stone, etc. All enemies are _made of stone_ and all of the loot is at least _Standard_ but also _Heavy_.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11-12           | Evil                   | The place has an overwhelming aura of evil. All healing in this dungeon is reduced by 1/2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13              | Ancient                | Because the space is so ancient, all loot there is _Flimsy_ on rolls 1-13 but _Unique_ on 15-17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 14              | Labyrinthine           | A system of tubes. _Room Type_ is always corridor, and the first room must have at least 3 doors. After 3 rooms have been generated, any doors rolled can no longer be *Exits* and any exit rolled becomes a *Blocked* door. Because it is hard to get around these spaces, the loot found there is always at least _Standard_ (on a 1-12). |
| 15              | Picked-Over            | Any loot found cannot be _Exceptional_, _Ornate_, or _Unique_ (reroll), but if you explore six rooms you find one _Magic_ item.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 16              | Flooded                | The dungeon is filled with waist-deep water. Moving from one room to another takes _two turns_, electric attacks do double damage, and any non-magical paper loot found is useless and worthless.                                                                                                                                           |
| 17              | Ultra-Dark             | Only party members with _darkvision_ can see properly; torches do nothing to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18              | Seething with Enemies  | Anytime one creature is rolled, 2x that creature shows up instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19              | Bountiful              | Anytime loot is rolled, roll twice and take both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20              | Roll Twice             | Roll twice on this table and apply both sets of effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | *Buzzing Host*: A man made of thousands of bees. Can only be damaged by spells and magical attacks. Damage is spread equally among the party. | 15 | 3d6 |
| 2 | *The Spoiled Egg*: A grotesque chicken-like creature dripping with puss and other nastiness which has a somewhat turtle-like relationship to the egg it has refused to leave behind. The nastiness of the thing causes the two lowest *WIS* party members to *panic* until the creature is slain or the party escapes.  | 20 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d6 Imps: If one imp remains at the end of any turn, they call for a random *demonic* creature. | 3 each | 1d4 |
| 4 | *Demonic Posession*: The lowest *STR* party member suddenly turns on their peers. They must be defeated in combat, after which point they will wake up with 1 health and become permanently *depressed*. | **N/A** | **N/A**<br> |
| 5 | *Demonic Incursion*: The party witnesses the departure of a demonic army. Upon returning to the hex world, the party will find that the last settlement they were in (less the capital) has been destroyed. If the party has not encountered another settlement yet, the first one they find is destroyed. In either case, the party may enter a *ruins* dungeon from that hex. | **N/A**<br> | **N/A**<br> |
| 6 | *Demonic Pact*: The highest *WIS* party member makes a demonic pact, gaining a new spell but losing 2 *STR*. | **N/A**<br> | **N/A**<br> |

| 2 | *Living Gem*: A gleaming, spinning jewel. Cannot be damaged by anything that couldn't logically hurt stone. Damage done is spread evenly among the party.  | 20 | 2d6 |

| 4 | *Elemental Devastation*: The lowest *DEX* character has a catastrophic interaction with some kind of hazard relating to the relevent element, taking 1d6 damage and gaining a fear of that element: they take double damage from that element going forward. | **N/A** | **N/A**<br> |
| 5 | *Elemental Revolution*: Reroll the element associated with the dungeon. | **N/A**<br> | **N/A**<br> |
