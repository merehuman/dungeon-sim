| 7-9             | Monster Den       | All characters are _[[Status Conditions\|sickened]]_ by the smell of the den while inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| 10-11           | Bandit Hideout    | The tenth room in the dungeon is guaranteed to contain a _Bandit Leader_ and 2x loot in addition to any other enemies rolled. All non-humanoid enemies are considered enslaved creatures: they will join the npc in battle if treated with care in a quiet moment.                                                                             |     |

| 14-15           | Underdark         | Dungeon exits lead to any hex up to 3 hexes away.

| 18              | Elemental         | Roll on the random element table. All magic loot and enemies are modified by that element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

| 20              | The Forecamp      | A 1 room dungeon, guarded by _a keeper_. If they are defeated, the tunnel in the Forecamp can be used to move back to The Capital at will. Only one Forecamp may exist on the hexmap at a time; if a new Forecamp is discovered the previous tunnel collapses. When you defeat the _keeper_, you also receive one Forecamp specific loot item. |     |
_Note: In addition to all of the effects listed, you roll on the corresponding encounter and enemy tables when appropriate._

#### **Dungeon Modifiers:**

| **Roll (1d20)** | **Modifier** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1-5 | None | No effect. |
| 6-8 | Trapped | Every second room explored (starting with Room 2) is _trapped_. |
| 9-10 | Geologically Fantastic | A crystalline cavern, a castle made of some special dark stone, etc. All enemies are _made of stone_ and all of the loot is at least _Standard_ (on 1-12_,_ but also _Heavy_. |
| 11-12 | Evil | The place has an overwhelming aura of evil. All healing in this dungeon is reduced by 1/2. |
| 13 | Ancient | Because the space is so ancient, all loot there is _Flimsy_ on rolls 1-13 but _Unique_ on 15-17. |
| 14 | Labyrinthine | A system of tubes. _Room Type_ is always coridor, and the first room must have at least 3 exits. Because it is hard to get around these spaces, the loot found there is always at least _Standard_ (on a 1-12). |
| 15 | Picked-Over | Any loot found cannot be _Exceptional_, _Ornate_, or _Unique_ (reroll), but if you explore fifteen rooms you find one _Magic_ item. |
| 16 | Flooded | The dungeon is filled with waist-deep water. Moving from one room to another takes _two turns_, electric attacks do double damage, and any non-magical paper loot found is useless and worthless. |
| 17 | Ultra-Dark | Only party members with _darkvision_ can see properly; torches do nothing to help. |
| 18 | Seething with Enemies | Anytime an enemy is rolled, 2x that enemy shows up instead. |
| 19 | Bountiful | Anytime loot is rolled, roll twice and take both. |
| 20 | Roll Twice | Roll twice on this table and combine the results. |

#### **Room Type:**
| **Roll (3d6)** | **Type** | Shape       | Origin  |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| 1-3            | Passage  | Rounded     | Natural |
| 4-6            | Room     | Rectilinear | Manmade |
#### **Room Size:**
| **Roll (1d12)** | **Size** |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Tiny |
| 2-4 | Small |
| 5-8 | Medium |
| 9-10 | Large |
| 10-11 | Huge |
| 12 | Gargantuan |
#### **Number of Exits:**

| **Roll (1d12)** | **Number of Exits** |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1-3 | None |
| 4-8 | 1 |
| 9-11 | 2 |
| 12 | 3 |
#### **Dungeon Door Choice (which door to go through, or exit):**

When the party is in a room with one or more exits, roll on the table that matches the number of exits. The result is either **Exit** (leave the dungeon) or **Door A**, **Door B**, etc. (go through that door into a new room). Only a roll of **Exit** ends the dungeon crawl from this step.

| **Number of Exits** | **Roll** | **Result** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1d4 | 1 = Exit, 2–4 = Door A |
| 2 | 1d6 | 1 = Exit, 2–3 = Door A, 4–5 = Door B, 6 = Door B |
| 3 | 1d8 | 1 = Exit, 2–3 = Door A, 4–5 = Door B, 6–7 = Door C, 8 = Door C |
| 4 | 1d6 | 1 = Exit, 2 = Door A, 3 = Door B, 4 = Door C, 5 = Door D, 6 = Door D |
| 5+ | 1d(N+1) | 1 = Exit, 2 = Door 1, 3 = Door 2, … , N+1 = Door N |

*For 5 or more exits, use a die with N+1 sides (e.g. 1d6 for 5 exits, 1d12 for 11 exits); 1 = Exit, each other face = one door.*

#### **Backtrack — which unused door (when continuing from a dead end):**

When the party is at a dead end and rolls 5–10 on the Dead End table (continue exploring), use this to choose which previously unused door to go through. Roll 1dK where K = number of available (unused) doors in the room you are backtracking to; each result corresponds to one of those doors.

| **Available unused doors (K)** | **Roll** | **Result** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | — | That door |
| 2 | 1d2 | 1 = first unused, 2 = second unused |
| 3 | 1d3 | 1 = first, 2 = second, 3 = third |
| 4 | 1d4 | 1–4 = first, second, third, fourth |
| 5+ | 1dK | 1 = first, 2 = second, … , K = K-th |

#### **Dead End (no exits):**

When the party reaches a room with no exits, do **not** leave immediately. Roll 1d10:

| **Roll (1d10)** | **Result** |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1–4 | Leave the dungeon (full rest, danger roll, then hexcrawling). |
| 5–10 | Continue exploring: choose one of the doors the party has not yet used in a previously visited room. Roll on **Backtrack — which unused door** for that room’s available doors, then proceed through that door into a new room (roll new room as usual). |

#### **Exit Types:**
| **Roll (1d20)** | **Type of Door** |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1-5 | Open |
| 6-9 | Locked |
| 10-12 | Blocked |
| 13-14 | Trapped (Open) |
| 14-15 | Trapped (Locked) |
| 16 | Stairs Up |
| 17 | Stairs Down |
| 18 | Secret |
| 19 | Dungeon Exit |
| 20 | Roll Twice |
_Special Rule_: If you “roll twice” and roll a trapped door, roll again if your other roll is a 1-9.
